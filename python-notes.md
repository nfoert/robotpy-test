# Python Notes
These are things I've noticed that are different/more annoying with Python

- The robotpy docs site has some weird links that lead to outdated sub pages for each project (phoenix6, etc.)
- Applying motor configs seems to work differently? There is no `getConfigurator()` function
- look into naming conventions. Should private objects use an underscore to start?
- Most things just seems to be an autogenerated mirror from java
